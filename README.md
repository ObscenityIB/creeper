# What's it do?
Uses [masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan/) to scan the internet for Minecraft速 servers,
then uses Dinnerbone's [mcstatus](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus) to grab the GameSpy4 data,
cleaning up the process of doing it manually.

Tested with:
- Arch Linux - 2024.08.01 - [Release](https://archlinux.org/download/)
- Ubuntu - 24.10 - [Oracular Oriole](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/)
- Kali Linux - [Bleeding Edge](https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/)
- masscan - [robertdavidgraham/masscan@`dfd2001`](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan/commit/dfd20019c2fe06b915165324e808652ccddba723)
- mcstatus - [py-mine/mcstatus@`338eb93`](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/commit/338eb931bf0650cf58fa67036193dcaa0dc76797)
- mcc - [MCCTeam/Minecraft-Console-Client@`ca966a4`](https://github.com/MCCTeam/Minecraft-Console-Client/commit/ca966a464c2262a7b51f6395fe901b12b832e7ee)

# But why?
Purely because its easier to shorten the process by making it scripted, then I just cleaned it up for
public release, so other people can have fun joining random servers.

The process usually goes like this:
1. Scan ISP range.
2. See players online in a server.
3. Switch to the appropriate Minecraft速 version.
4. Join the server.

Various reactions ensue, from "Hello?" to...

### Connection Lost
#### You are banned from this server.

# Don't forget!
If you have the chance, inform the server owners that their home router (if applicable) has its port
exposed to the internet, and should either close it, or use a whitelist.

Some people just forget, or don't understand what they are doing.
