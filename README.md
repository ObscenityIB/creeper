## creeper.sh
#### The Offensive Global Minecraft速 Server Scanner

# What's it do?
Uses [masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan/) to scan the internet for Minecraft速 servers,
then uses Dinnerbone's [mcstatus](https://dinnerbone.com/minecraft/tools/status/) to grab the GameSpy3 data,
cleaning up the process of doing it manually.

Tested with:
- Ubuntu - 21.04 - Hirsute Hippo
- Kali Linux - Bleeding Edge
- masscan - robertdavidgraham/masscan@3ad77be62180d846e127787d1f7d62174c3a5970
- mcstatus - Dinnerbone/mcstatus@fa1770578e96d65a92a5d7daea3fa0485e29be1e
- mcc - ORelio/Minecraft-Console-Client@771a5b9e08d9292c3a11878c7c4dbb2d7ee4c643

# But why?
Purely because its easier to shorten the process by making it scripted, then I just cleaned it up for
public release, so other people can have fun joining random servers.

The process usually goes like this:
1. Scan ISP range.
2. See players online in a server.
3. Switch to the appropriate Minecraft速 version.
4. Join the server.

Various reactions ensue, from "Hello?" to...

### Connection Lost
#### You are banned from this server.

# Don't forget!
If you have the chance, inform the server owners that their home router (if applicable) has its port
exposed to the internet, and should either close it, or use a whitelist.

Some people just forget, or don't understand what they are doing.
