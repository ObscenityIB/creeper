# What's it do?
Uses [masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan/) to scan the internet for Minecraft速 servers,
then uses Dinnerbone's [mcstatus](https://dinnerbone.com/minecraft/tools/status/) to grab the GameSpy3 data,
cleaning up the process of doing it manually.

Tested with:
- Ubuntu - 21.10 - [Impish Indri](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-canary/current/)
- Kali Linux - [Bleeding Edge](https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/)
- masscan - [robertdavidgraham/masscan@`144c527`](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan/commit/144c527ed55275ee9fbb80bb14fbb5e3fcff3b7e)
- mcstatus - [Dinnerbone/mcstatus@`10cea64`](https://github.com/Dinnerbone/mcstatus/commit/10cea643fa3866063c6b5b327fe890213ecee7f2)
- mcc - [ORelio/Minecraft-Console-Client@`41b0325`](https://github.com/ORelio/Minecraft-Console-Client/commit/41b0325f45b3084ae66ced37e9311927360d6aa8)

# But why?
Purely because its easier to shorten the process by making it scripted, then I just cleaned it up for
public release, so other people can have fun joining random servers.

The process usually goes like this:
1. Scan ISP range.
2. See players online in a server.
3. Switch to the appropriate Minecraft速 version.
4. Join the server.

Various reactions ensue, from "Hello?" to...

### Connection Lost
#### You are banned from this server.

# Don't forget!
If you have the chance, inform the server owners that their home router (if applicable) has its port
exposed to the internet, and should either close it, or use a whitelist.

Some people just forget, or don't understand what they are doing.
